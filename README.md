## Hi there ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jimmy and I am a software engineer and technical lead in the San Francisco Bay Area. My expertise is in building secure, scalable enterprise web applications and integrating best CI/CD practices throughout the software development lifecycle. I have also been involved in video decoding ([H.264](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.264), [VC-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC-1)) on the GPU, GPGPU ([OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl)), and heterogeneous computing ([oneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html), [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl)) and AI. I believe AI has the power to enrich and improve the quality of everyone's life, and am passionate about incoporating AI into web applications to enhance user experience.

I'm very active in the open source community and have contributed or been involved in the following open source projects.
 
| Projects                                                                          | Impact      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples)         | I have been the maintainer of the oneAPI-samples repo since 2022. Reviewed PRs, fixed bugs and contributed new code samples. Ask me anything about oneAPI and SYCL! |
| [intel/AI-PC-Samples](https://github.com/intel/AI-PC-Samples)                     | I'm also the maintainer of the AI-PC-Samples repo. Check out some of these cool AI code samples that can run on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra Processors! | 
| [jimmytwei/polite-guard-webapp](https://github.com/jimmytwei/polite-guard-webapp) | I created two code samples demonstrating how to run the [Polite Guard](https://huggingface.co/Intel/polite-guard) Small Language Model (SLM) in the web browser. One of the samples even runs fully locally in the browser, with no data being sent across the Internet! I believe this is the future of browser apps, as compute and memory on PCs increase and privacy becomes increasingly important. |
| [gitana/alpaca](https://github.com/gitana/alpaca)                                 | Alpaca is a very cool JavaScript library for generating dynamic HTML5 forms from a JSON schema using existing user interfaces such as Bootstrap. I have used it in my own projects and have reported bug issues. |

I have also wrote and contributed articles in the developer community. Check out [this](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1042478/Building-Gesture-Recognition-Web-Apps-with-Intel-R) article I wrote on CodeProject on how to build gesture recognition web applications using the IntelÂ® RealSenseâ„¢ SDK and the F200 camera!

I am a strong believer in adopting a security first, shift left mindset when it comes to software development. I have found security vulnerabilities across many different websites. In 2019, I reported a high severity vulnerability on the United Airlines website through their [Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/united-airlines-vulnerability-disclosure-program.html) and received 500,000 award miles for my submission.

Please feel free to reach out to me via e-mail for open source collaborations or potential new job opportunities. A copy of my resume can be found [here](./resume.pdf).
