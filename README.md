## Hi there ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Jimmy and I am a software engineer and technical lead in the San Francisco Bay Area. My expertise is in building secure, scalable enterprise web applications and integrating best CI/CD practices throughout the software development lifecycle. I have also been involved in video decoding ([H.264](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.264), [VC-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC-1)) on the GPU, GPGPU ([OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl)), heterogeneous computing ([oneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html), [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl)) and AI.

I am very active in the open source community and have been involved in the following open source projects.
 
| Projects                                                                          | Impact      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples)         | I have been a maintainer of the oneAPI-samples repo since 2022. Ask me anything about oneAPI and SYCL! |
| [intel/AI-PC-Samples](https://github.com/intel/AI-PC-Samples)                     | I am also a maintainer of the AI-PC-Samples repo. Check out some of these cool AI PC code samples that can run on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra Processors! | 
| [jimmytwei/polite-guard-webapp](https://github.com/jimmytwei/polite-guard-webapp) | I created two code samples demonstrating how to run the [Polite Guard](https://huggingface.co/Intel/polite-guard) Small Language Model (SLM) in the [web browser](https://jimmytwei.github.io/polite-guard). One of the samples even runs inferencing locally in the browser, with no data being sent across the Internet! I believe this is the future of browser apps, as compute and memory on PCs increase and the privacy of user's data becomes increasingly important. |
| [gitana/alpaca](https://github.com/gitana/alpaca)                                 | Alpaca is a very cool JavaScript library for generating dynamic HTML5 forms from a JSON schema using existing user interfaces such as Bootstrap. I have used it in my own projects and reported bugs. |

I wrote and contributed articles for the developer community. Check out [this](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1042478/Building-Gesture-Recognition-Web-Apps-with-Intel-R) article I wrote on CodeProject on how to build gesture recognition web applications using the IntelÂ® RealSenseâ„¢ SDK and the F200 camera!

I am a strong believer in adopting a security first mindset when it comes to software development. In 2019, I reported a high severity vulnerability on the United Airlines website through their [Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/united-airlines-vulnerability-disclosure-program.html) and received 500,000 award miles for my submission. I was not thrilled that I had to pay taxes on those miles. :)

Please feel free to reach out to me via e-mail for open source collaborations, consulting, or potential new job opportunities. A copy of my resume can be found [here](./resume.pdf).
