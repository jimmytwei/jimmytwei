## Hi there ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jimmy and I am a software engineer in the Bay Area. My expertise is in building scalable enterprise web applications and integrating best CI/CD practices throughout the software development lifecycle. I have also been involved in video decoding (H.264/AVC, VC-1) on the GPU, OpenCL, and heterogeneous computing (oneAPI, SYCL) and AI. I believe AI 

I'm passionate about the open source community and have contributed or been involved in the following open-source projects.
 
| Projects                                                                          | Impact      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples)         | I have been the maintainer of the oneAPI-samples repo since 2022. Reviewed PRs, fixed bugs and contributed new code samples. Ask me anything about oneAPI and SYCL! |
| [intel/AI-PC-Samples](https://github.com/intel/AI-PC-Samples)                     | I'm also the maintainer of the AI-PC-Samples repo. Check out some of these cool AI code samples that can run on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ Ultra Processors! | 
| [gitana/alpaca](https://github.com/gitana/alpaca)                                 | Alpaca is a very cool JavaScript library for generating dynamic HTML5 forms from a JSON schema using existing user interfaces such as Bootstrap. I've used it in my own projects and have reported bug issues. |
| [jimmytwei/polite-guard-webapp](https://github.com/jimmytwei/polite-guard-webapp) | I created two code samples demonstrating how to run the Polite Guard Small Language Model (SLM) in the web browser. One code sample runs fully locally in the browser, with no data being sent across the Internet! I believe this is the future of browser apps (and apps in general), as privacy becomes increasingly important. |
